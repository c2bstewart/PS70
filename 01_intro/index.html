#### Week 1: Final Project Proposal 

At the moment, I have two main ideas for my final project.

The first would be a small macro keypad, with probably around 8 single keys
and two clickable encoder wheels. The main goal of this keypad would be to make
it faster for me to program on lighting consoles like the ETC Ion, which use a
command-line syntax. The nature of lighting programming means there are often
repetetive commands that require lots of keypresses, obscure softkeys reached
through menus, or both, so professional programmers often create macro sequences
to improve their efficiency.

Ideally, I would create a mechanical keypad with a matching interface that would
allow me to assign and reassign the keys to various macros or other command
sequences. In an ambitious world, the keypad would also be able to switch
between multiple profiles so that I could use it for everyday work in addition
to lighting.
