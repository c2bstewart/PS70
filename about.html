### About Me

<div class="flexrow">

  <p id="aboutme">
    Hey there! I'm Clarissa, a senior in Leverett studying Linguistics
    with a bit of Computer Science. This is my website where I document
    my work for PHYSCI 70: Intro to Digital Fabrication.
  </p>

I took GENED 1080 in the fall of 2021 and had a great time learning
about 3D printing, laser cutting, and basic electronics. For my final
project in that course, I made this lyre:

<div class="flexrow">
  <img src="./harp-front.jpeg" alt="the front of a small wooden lyre" width=25%>
  <img src="./harp-back.jpeg" alt="the back of a the same lyre" width=25%>
</div>
<!-- ![the front of a small wooden lyre](./harp-front.jpeg)
![the back of the same lyre](./harp-back.jpeg) -->

<p class="caption">(It's about 2 feet tall, for reference.)</p>

I also spend a lot of time outside of class working backstage on
theatrical shows. Specifically, I design, program, and operate the
lighting. Through stage lighting, I've learned about 2D drafting with
CAD software and gotten pretty good at ETC console programming.

Head on over to my page on [Week 1](./01_intro/index.html) to check out my ideas for my final project!
