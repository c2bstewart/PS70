### About Me

Hey there! I'm Clarissa, a senior in Leverett studying Linguistics
with a bit of Computer Science. This is my website where I document
my work for PHYSCI 70: Intro to Digital Fabrication.

I took GENED 1080 in the fall of 2021 and had a great time learning
about 3D printing, laser cutting, and basic electronics. For my final
project in that course, I made this lyre:

![the back of the same lyre](./harp-back.jpeg)

(It's about 2 feet tall, for reference.)

I also spend a lot of time outside of class working backstage on
theatrical shows. Specifically, I design, program, and operate the
lighting. Through stage lighting, I've learned about 2D drafting with
CAD software and gotten pretty good at ETC console programming.

This is a photo of a ballet show I lit in the spring of 2022.

Head on over to my page on [Week 1](./01_intro/index.html) to check out my ideas for my final project!
